 # Gene
 
 "Genes can acquire mutations in their sequence, leading to different variants, known as alleles, in the population. These alleles encode slightly different versions of a protein, which cause different phenotypical traits. Usage of the term "having a gene" (e.g., "good genes," "hair colour gene") typically refers to containing a different allele of the same, shared gene. Genes evolve due to natural selection / survival of the fittest and genetic drift of the alleles."

 All the features of living things are determined by their genes. Likewise, all the features of the shapes here are determined by their genes.
 
 Below are 4 genes of our shape. The shape will also change if you change the genes. This way you can get the shape you want! ðŸŽ©
